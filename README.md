# multiplication-app
a multiplication app with added functionality
it generates 2 random numbers and multiplies them together. 
If you get the answer right your get a point, if you get it wrong you loses a point


What I learned

HTML
used a form for the first time to pass in all the data when button clicked
used input field with placeholder autofocus and turned off autocomplete properties


CSS
display block and box-sizing:border-box to center content equally spaced from border
for the button: cursor:pointer and filter for the button hover effect


JS
-localStorage class for browser memory
-event listener added to form to submit inputs
-stringify and parseInt for changing data type
- .innerText for changing content of text on page
